# Face_recognizer
1.There are 2 files in this rep. one which has training and prediction functions and one with the implementation of them 
2.steps to be followed ->
3.place all the files in the same folder and then create a folder named faces or as you wish and create a folder for each person whose 
image you have to train the model and place their photos inside them and update the path in  face_pred.py so that images can be accessed
4.Then run the file you get a opencv window where video is displayed and name of face predicted is displayed.
5.As the model we use and the face detector have a chance of high False positives so the accuracy of the model may be low.give more images to train to increase its accuracy (40-50).
